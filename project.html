                    <p>Our main users were students from Drexel Penn, as well as local professors, faculty, and workers who are looking for a quick bite to eat and are more likely to continue using the app. We also thought about tourists and visiting families and included them in our customer base, though they wouldn't likely use the app often.</p>

She is happy when she is well informed by food options and progress markers. So, we made these main features of our app.</p>
