                    <p>Our main users were students from Drexel Penn, as well as local professors, faculty, and workers who are looking for a quick bite to eat and are more likely to continue using the app. We also thought about tourists and visiting families and included them in our customer base, though they wouldn't likely use the app often.</p>

                    <p>We mapped out her journey, framing a process where she is constricted by class times and is able to use the app to streamline her process and order food quickly. She is happy when she is well informed by food options and progress markers. So, we made these main features of our app.</p>
